Web app with funny creatures

The idea
===
It's an app build for fun of creating,
changing and analysing. It's basic goal is to generate really funny
and pleasant looking `creatures`.


I want to use some fairly not complicated logic to compute and build various models of creatures.
It would be an experiment, because I've never done such thing before and I really don't know much
about 3d modeling. After generating - creatures would be displayed and hopefully animated :).


Various users (site visitors) would have possiblities too modify models
and vote for the ones they like. It would be used as a natural selection for models, because
generating methods would analyse this feedback and behave accordingly.


Models should be easy to download and for example easy to print on 3d printer.


Implementation
===
Frontend would be developed strictly in html and js. I use here angular.js which I
really don't know yet - but hope to learn in the process of building. I want to use webgl and three.js for
displaying and animating 3D models.

For backend, storing and analysing I use python, which provides http api using flask with classy.

TODO
===
- Implement!
- Create some interface mockups/drafts.
- Start playing with generating and displaying models
